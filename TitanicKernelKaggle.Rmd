# Introduction

This is my first attempt at Kaggle and writing a full data project. I focuss here on Feature Engineering,
my next Kernel will take more of a look at the modelling and diagnostic side. Please reach out with any
questions or advice, I'm here to learn and build my network.

## Loading libraries and data

```{r,message=FALSE}
# Loading libraries
library(ggplot2) #charting
library(plyr) #data wrangling
library(dplyr) #data wrangling
library(Hmisc) #data wrangling
library(mice) #imputing variables
library(randomForest) #modelling
library(caret) #modelling


traindata <- read.csv('../input/train.csv', stringsAsFactors = F)
testdata <- read.csv('../input/test.csv', stringsAsFactors = F)

c(object.size(traindata),object.size(testdata)) ## data is small so performance shouldn't be an issue

## I want to combine training and test sets because this makes it easier to perform the same 
## operations on both sets

testdata$Survived <- "NA"
merged <- rbind(traindata,testdata)

length(unique(merged$PassengerId)) == length(merged$PassengerId) ## check no duped entries
```

# Pre Clean Exploratory Data Analysis

I find it useful to guess what I think data will look like, as this gives me a benchmark to 
either support or attack in my initial analysis. Intuitively I would guess that anyone of higher
class, either by ticket class itself or cost, would have a better chance of survival, as would
women, children, and the elderly. Perhaps families too would be given a better chance of all getting
into a lifeboat together as opposed to someone travelling alone?

For detailed impormation about features check here https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data

```{r}
head(merged)
colSums(is.na(merged))
colSums(merged=="")
```


So there seems to be a lot of data missing in the Age variable and I would guess this contains a 
lot of information. I have seen other people trying to impute age (use the mean for example) but 
this is too much of a fudge for me and I'd rather train two models, one with age and one without.

Let's look at charts of survivor trends by age, class, gender

## Class & Sex

```{r}
merged$Pclass <- as.factor(merged$Pclass)
merged$Sex <- as.factor(merged$Sex)

g <- ggplot(merged[1:891,], aes(x=Pclass,fill=factor(Survived))) + geom_bar() + labs(fill = "Survived")
g <- g + labs(title="Survivor split by ticket class")
g

g <- g + facet_wrap(~Sex) + labs(title="Survivor split by ticket class and gender")
g
```

As expected, higher class of ticket and female gender seem to be good positive predictors of survival.

## Age

I would like to segment by age and create a new feature for age bracket as having so many individual ages 
in the model would probably lead to overfitting.

```{r}
qplot(merged$Age)

agebrackets <- c(0,13,18,30,55)
merged$Agebracket <- findInterval(merged$Age,agebrackets)

agetable <- data.frame(Agebracket=c(1,2,3,4,5),Age_range=c("<13","13-17","18-29","30-54","55+"))
merged <- join(merged,agetable,by="Agebracket")
merged$Agebracket <- as.factor(merged$Agebracket)

g <- ggplot(merged[1:891,], aes(x=Age_range,fill=factor(Survived))) + geom_bar() + labs(fill = "Survived")
g <- g + labs(title="Survivor split by age group")
g

g <- g + facet_wrap(~Sex) + labs(title="Survivor split by age and gender")
g
```

Age bracket seems to give a lot of information, with youger generally having a better chance
of survival. Interestingly elderly women has a very good chance of survival whereas elderly men
had a very bad chance so it looks like this is a useful division.


# Feature Engineering, Cleaning and Completing the Data

As discussed before I intend to split up the data into those with Age data and those without, this 
seems pretty central. However I want to see if this improves performance so I will do that once I've
trained and tested a few models on the comibined set. The other variable with many missing entries
is Cabin. I'm guessing this isn't just missing data, but that a lot of people didn't have a Cabin.
So I'm thinking of turning this into a 2 factor variable, has / does not have cabin.

## Cabin

```{r}
head(merged$Cabin,30)
length(unique(merged$Cabin))/length(merged$Cabin) ## only 14% are unique so there are a lot shared.
merged$Cabin[28] # this looks strange, multiple cabins on one ticket
subset(merged,Cabin == "C23 C25 C27") # it was one family, the Fortunes

merged$HasCabin <- as.factor(!(merged$Cabin==""))

g <- ggplot(merged[1:891,], aes(x=HasCabin,fill=factor(Survived))) + geom_bar()
g <- g +facet_wrap(~Pclass) + labs(title="Survivor split by class and Cabin")
g
```

As expected few people in Class 2 and 3 had cabins, but actually those who did had a good chance of 
survival. Helping to capture the smaller number who survived from lower classes should be very additive.

## Fare

```{r}
qplot(merged$Fare,bins=150)
```

There doesn't seem to be natural brackets here unlike age, so I will just
split in equal groups. There is one missing entry for Fare, I will impute
the average Fare for his Pclass.

```{r}
subset(merged,is.na(merged$Fare))
merged[1044,]$Fare <- mean(subset(merged,Pclass==3)$Fare,na.rm=TRUE)

merged$Farebracket <- as.factor(cut2(merged$Fare,g=5))

g <- ggplot(merged[1:891,], aes(x=Farebracket,fill=factor(Survived))) + geom_bar()
g <- g +facet_wrap(~Pclass) + labs(title="Survivor split by class and Fare Bracket")
g <- g + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
g 

subset(merged,Fare==0)
```

This is more useful than expected, it does seem to split out the survivors within
a class quite nicely. There were 17 people who paid 0 fare including some in first
class - I don't think its worth creating a separate category here though.

One group paid over $500! But is ticket overall cost or each ticket?

```{r}
head(order(merged$Fare,decreasing = TRUE))
merged[259,]

subset(merged,Fare==merged$Fare[259])
```


Just for fun: from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic_(1997_film) 
Jack Dawson is actually Joseph Dawson, who is not in our sample,
and neither is Rose. I didn't need a model to classify them anyway.

```{r}
grep("Dawson",merged$Name)
merged[grep("Rose",merged$Name),]
```

## Title

```{r}
merged$Title <- gsub('(.*, )|(\\..*)', '', merged$Name)

count(merged,Title)

VIP <- c("Capt","Col","Don","Dona","Dr","Jonkheer","Lady","Major",
         "Mlle", "Mme","Rev","Sir","the Countess")

merged$Title[merged$Title %in% VIP] <- "VIP"
merged$Title <- as.factor(merged$Title)

count(merged,Title)

## I'm not that keen on only having 2 in the "Ms" camp
merged[merged$Title=="Ms",]$Title <- "Mrs"

g <- ggplot(merged[1:891,], aes(x=Title,fill=factor(Survived))) + geom_bar()
g <- g +facet_wrap(~Pclass) + labs(title="Survivor split by class and Title")
g
```

I'm not sure how useful this is going to be based on the charts.

## Name

Onto surname, I'm interested to see if there was some racial bias here.


```{r,message=FALSE}
library(wru) # who r u - library to guess race from surname

merged$surname<- gsub("([A-Za-z]+).*", "\\1", merged$Name)

raceprobs <- predict_race(merged,surname.only = TRUE)
racepreds <- suppressWarnings(colnames(raceprobs)[apply(raceprobs,1,which.max)])
merged$Race <- as.factor(sub('.*\\.', '',racepreds))

g <- ggplot(merged[1:891,], aes(x=Race,fill=factor(Survived))) + geom_bar()
g <- g +facet_wrap(~Pclass) + labs(title="Survivor split by class and Race")
g
```

It looks like such a high proportion is white that this will be of little use.

## Ticketsize variable

Create a variable for number of people on a single tickt to give a count for group size.

```{r}
merged <- ddply(merged,.(Ticket),transform,Ticketsize=length(Ticket))
merged$Ticketsize <- as.factor(merged$Ticketsize)
merged <- merged[order(merged$PassengerId),] # ddply mixes up order
```

## Embarked

Move the two cases where this is unmarked to the modal case, "S"

```{r}
count(merged,Embarked)
subset(merged,Embarked == "")
merged[c(62,830),"Embarked"] <- "S"
merged$Embarked <- as.factor(merged$Embarked)
```

## Age

To begin with, I want to use the mice library to impute the missing ages.
Then I want to check if we get improvement by splitting data as explained
above; this seems pivtotal to the analysis.

```{r}
factors <- c("Pclass","Sex","Agebracket","Title")
set.seed(1234)

m1 <- merged[, !names(merged) %in% c("Agebracket","Age_range")]
mice_ages <- mice(m1[, !names(m1) %in% factors], method='rf')
mice_out <- complete(mice_ages)

# I am creating a new variable for the imputed ages because I want to later compare to 
# training a model both for entries with and without ages.
```

```{r}
mergedages <- merged[,!names(merged) == "Age_range"]
mergedages$Age <- mice_out$Age

mergedages$Agebracket <- findInterval(mergedages$Age,agebrackets)
mergedages <- join(mergedages,agetable,by="Agebracket")
mergedages$Agebracket <- as.factor(mergedages$Agebracket)

colSums(is.na(mergedages))
colSums(mergedages=="")
```

We are ready to start fitting some models!

# Model Fitting

First split the data back into training/ CV and set we use for submission,

```{r}
mergedagestrain <- mergedages[1:891,]
mergedagestest <- mergedages[892:1309,]
mergedagestrain$Survived <- as.factor(traindata$Survived)

set.seed(414)
inTrain<- createDataPartition(y=mergedagestrain$Survived,p=0.75, list=FALSE)
train <- mergedagestrain[inTrain,]
test <- mergedagestrain[-inTrain,]
```

## Logistic Regression

```{r}
set.seed(414)
logreg <- glm(Survived ~ Pclass + Sex + Agebracket +
                      Farebracket + HasCabin + Ticketsize
               + Title + Embarked, family = binomial(link=logit), 
              data = train)

summary(logreg)

prediction <- predict(logreg,newdata=test,type="response")
prediction <- ifelse(prediction > 0.5,1,0)
misClasificError <- mean(prediction != test$Survived)
print(paste('Accuracy',1-misClasificError)) ## Accuracy 81%
```

## Regularised Logistic Regression using lasso

Let's see if we can improve the model using lasso regularisation

```{r}
set.seed(414)
library(glmnet)
x <- model.matrix(Survived ~ Pclass + Sex + Farebracket + HasCabin + Ticketsize + Embarked + Title,train)
cv.out <- cv.glmnet(x,y=train$Survived,alpha=1,family="binomial",type.measure = "mse") #select lambda -4

#best value of lambda
lambda_1se <- cv.out$lambda.1se

xtest <- model.matrix(Survived ~ Pclass + Sex + Farebracket + HasCabin + Ticketsize + Embarked + Title,test)
lasso_prob <- predict(cv.out,newx = xtest,s=lambda_1se,type="response")
#translate probabilities to predictions

lasso_predict <- rep("0",nrow(test))
lasso_predict[lasso_prob>.5] <-"1"
#confusion matrix
table(pred=lasso_predict,true=test$Survived)

mean(lasso_predict==test$Survived) #82% accuracy
```

## Random Forest

```{r}
set.seed(414)
rf_model <- randomForest(factor(Survived) ~ Pclass + Sex + Agebracket +
                                 Farebracket + Race + HasCabin + Ticketsize +
                                 Embarked + Title,
                         data = mergedagestrain,na.action = na.pass)

rf_model
rf_model$confusion
varImpPlot(rf_model)
importance(rf_model)

set.seed(414)
rf_model2 <- randomForest(factor(Survived) ~ Pclass + Sex + Farebracket + HasCabin + Ticketsize + Embarked + Title,
                         data = mergedagestrain,na.action = na.pass,nodesize=20)

rf_model2 #looks the best
plot(rf_model2)
varImpPlot(rf_model2)
importance(rf_model2)
```

## GBM

```{r,message=FALSE}
features <- c("Survived","Pclass","Sex","SibSp","Parch","HasCabin","Farebracket","Title","Ticketsize","Age_range")
fitControl <- trainControl(method = "repeatedcv", number = 4, repeats = 4)

set.seed(414)
gbm1 <- suppressWarnings(train(as.factor(Survived) ~ ., data = train[features], 
              method = "gbm", trControl = fitControl,verbose = FALSE))
prediction <- predict(gbm1, test[features],type= "prob")
prediction <- data.frame(ifelse(prediction[,2] > 0.5,1,0))
mean(prediction[,1] == test$Survived) #83% accuracy

set.seed(414)
fitControl2 <- trainControl(method = "repeatedcv", number = 6, repeats = 4)
gbm2 <- suppressWarnings(train(as.factor(Survived) ~ ., data = train[features], 
              method = "gbm", trControl = fitControl,verbose = FALSE))
prediction <- predict(gbm2, test[features],type= "prob")
prediction <- data.frame(ifelse(prediction[,2] > 0.5,1,0))
mean(prediction[,1] == test$Survived) #83% accuracy
```

## Splitting models depending on whether age is available or not

```{r}
row.names(merged) <- merged$PassengerId
mergedtrain <- merged[1:891,]
mergedtest <- merged[892:1309,]
mergedtrain$Survived <- as.factor(mergedtrain$Survived)

sum(is.na(mergedtrain$Age))
sum(is.na(mergedtest$Age))

rf_model_ages <- randomForest(factor(Survived) ~ Pclass + Sex + Farebracket + HasCabin + Agebracket + Ticketsize + Embarked + Title,
                              data = mergedtrain[!is.na(mergedtrain$Age),],nodesize=20)

rf_model_ages
rf_model_ages$confusion
varImpPlot(rf_model_ages)
importance(rf_model_ages)


rf_model_noages <- randomForest(factor(Survived) ~ Pclass + Sex +
                                      Farebracket + Race + HasCabin + Ticketsize +
                                      Embarked + Title,
                              data = mergedtrain[is.na(mergedtrain$Age),],nodesize=20)

rf_model_noages
rf_model_noages$confusion
varImpPlot(rf_model_noages)
importance(rf_model_noages)

p1 <- predict(rf_model_ages, mergedtest[!is.na(mergedtest$Age),])
p2 <- predict(rf_model_noages, mergedtest[is.na(mergedtest$Age),])
prediction <- join(data.frame(PassengerId=names(p1),Survived=p1),data.frame(PassengerId=names(p2),Survived=p2))

# This actually didn't help my position on the leaderboard, pretty surprised by this
```

# Evaluation and submission

The model rf2 looks the best so I will submit that.

```{r}
prediction <- predict(rf_model2, mergedagestest)
submission <- data.frame(PassengerId=names(prediction),Survived=prediction)
if(!file.exists("./predictions.csv")) {
        write.csv(submission, file = "./predictions.csv",row.names = F)}
```

This submission got me into the top 6% which I was very pleased with for my first attempt.

I am a little puzzled how many of my intuitions were wrong, that splitting age into two models would
make a big difference, and the clearly crucial feature "Title" would not have much impact.

For my next project I want to take a more purposeful approach to model selection, with a more
extensive evaluation and diagnostics for parameter tuning. I also want to work on seeing how
feature engineering and model selection work in concert with each other.

Thanks for reading, if you've got this far surely its worth an upvote :)
