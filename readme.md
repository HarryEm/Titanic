This repo looks at two different approaches to Kaggle's famous Titanic competition: [Kaggle Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

## Notebooks

The files relate to two notebooks exploring both how [feature engineering](https://www.kaggle.com/harryem/feature-engineering-on-the-titanic-for-0-81339) and two different approaches for dealing with [missing data](https://www.kaggle.com/harryem/titanic-comparing-two-approaches-for-missing-data) can improve predictive accuracy.

## TitanicKernelKaggle is my first attempt at a full scale data project

## TitanicKernelKaggleRevisited is an extension piece comparing approaches to dealing with missing data

## TitanicTest.csv and TitanicTrain.csv are the raw data files
